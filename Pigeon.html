    Pigeons have been present with humans since ages
    The pigeons have been around humans for thousands of year. 5,000 years old Mesopotamian tablets have been found illustrating domestication of
     rock doves, a breed of pigeon. They have a worthy mention on Egyptian Hieroglyphs tablets as well, which were used until 400 AD by the Ancient
     Egyptians.History has suggested that they have been a companion of humans for more than 10,000 years and in all probability even go beyond that.

Pigeons have fought alongside humans in World War I and II
In a time where communication was difficult, pigeons were used to fly across borders to deliver messages to the military camp as well as to the 
allies. Pigeons have played a very important role in saving a countless number of lives throughout the history because of their homing skills as
 well as their pace. They have conveyed messages evading enemy fires and poisoned gases during both World War 1 and World War 2 to rescue the army
  and the navy stuck in deadlock situations. The Pigeons on their laurels have been bestowed with several awards, one of them being the Dickin 
  Medal, which was given to honour the bravery of animals in the World War II. During the World War era, Pigeons were known to be faster than
   telegraph messages. Pigeons are still used by French, Iraqi and Chinese armies

    Pigeon Races
    Did you know there is a specific breed of Pigeons called Racing Homer that were and are still used in the sport of racing? It is a sport where
     the trained pigeons are raced and the distance covered and the time taken is measured to evaluate the speed of all participant birds.
      The Pigeons travel at an average speed of 80 km/h while the highest speed recorded is 140 km/h. Although small inbuilt, they have strong wing
      muscles making them strong fliers. In fact, in the 19th century, this sport became so popular that the 1900 Olympics held in Paris contested 
      a Pigeon racing event.

    Navigational Technique
    The Pigeon racing events, as well as their involvement in the world wars, is all because of their unique navigation skills. Research has 
    proved that pigeons use earth's magnetic field and the position of the sun to find their way to the destination and that could easily be over
     a distance of 100 km. The Champions breed use landmarks as well as roads to determine their location. Some studies have suggested that they 
     also use their sense of smell while flying to reach their destination.
